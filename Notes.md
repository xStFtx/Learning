# Day 3 
File descriptors. Change if(clientFd > 0) to if(clientFd >= 0).

Valid file descriptors:
```
0  -> stdin
1  -> stdout
2  -> stderr
3+ -> sockets/files
```

## Working on command parsing. 
First tried an if else primitive setup. But that is not going to cut it. So I want to setup a command table.

# Day 4
I did a quiz to understand C++ better on the lower level. This includes:
- Compilation Model
- Core Language
- Memory Model
- Pointer Deep Dive

I asked Claude to generate a quiz and coding problems for this. I understand most of it. Had a point deduction here and there. Got 37/40.

From here on it is repetition and understanding the compiler better.
